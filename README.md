Custom theme that recreates the signalis UI

#

A custom variant of the theme "system24" by refact0r
https://github.com/refact0r/system24

#

The V2 theme is the same but with all the css imports in one file so i could be able to modify some unused system24 features that are suspected to cause lag
<br>
Since the V2 theme does not use imports it might get outdated at some point
